Convert this C++ program into x86 assembly language.
You must develop two separate functions as shown.#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

unsigned int x;
unsigned int y;

unsigned int Multiply(unsigned int x, unsigned int y)
{
    unsigned int a = 0;
    while (y != 0)
    {
        if ((y & 1) == 1)
        {
            a += x;
        }
        x <<= 1;
        y >>= 1;
    }
    return a;
}

int main()
{
    cout << "Enter a value for x: ";
    cin >> x;
    cout << "Enter a value for y: ";
    cin >> y;

    unsigned int r = Multiply(x, y);
   
    cout << "The result is: " << r << endl;
    system("PAUSE");
}
