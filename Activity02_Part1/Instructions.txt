Convert this C++ program exactly as you see it into x86 assembly language:

// Use the Irvine library for the print function
#include <iostream>

// The string that needs to be printed
char word[] = "Golf\0";
// Pointer to a specific character in the string
char * character = word;

// NOTE: This main() function is not portable outside of Visual Studio
void main()
{
    // Set up a LOOP - See the while loop's conditional expression below
    int ecx = 4;
    do
    {
        // Print the character
        // In x86 assembly language you must use the following two lines of code:
        // mov  al, WHATEVER_CHARACTER_YOU_WANT_TO_PRINT
        // call WriteChar
        std::cout << *character;
        // Increment the pointer
        ++character;
    } while (--ecx != 0);

    // In x86 assembly language you must use the following line of code:
    // call CrLf
    std::cout << std::endl;

    // In x86 assembly language you must use the following line of code:
    // call WaitMsg
    system("PAUSE");
